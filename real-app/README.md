This folder contains the code of a reasonably real application 
implemented in the language.

>This is my implementation of a Real App using Scala from my research of this language on File I/O

>To run the build you must have sbt installed, if you dont have it installed follow the instructions under build tools in main page.


>To Run the Build, first get into the root directory of the project in the terminal using `cd`. In this case the directory name is `file-reader`. Then compile the project build by simply typing `sbt` to enter the project build.
>It will show up like this after running `sbt` in the end: `sbt:file-reader>` 


>To Run the project, enter in `run` after compiling the project.
>It would be like this in the terminal: `sbt:file-reader> run`, so type run when the `sbt:file-reader>` appears


>It will prompt with an input and you can enter your file such as for example: `TestApp.txt` and it will show the text using File I/O
